# Image-reconstruction-and-classification
Done under Deep Learning in mechanical sciences(ME698G) course, IIT Kanpur

#### Binary image classification is done on data-set containing images of dogs and cats
#### Prepared a model to reconstruct and compress images using SVD and classify them into different categories
#### Used KNN, Logistic and SVM classifiers and compared their results to get best accuracy
